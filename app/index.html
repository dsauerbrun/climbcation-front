          <h3>Hi there, my name is Daniel Sauerbrun and I wrote Climbcation!</h3>
          <br />
          <h4><strong>So what is Climbcation you ask?</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Climbcation is a fun little idea I came up with when I was on a climbing vacation in Europe(hence Climbcation...).
            I was on a round the world trip and was a budding gym climber who brought his shoes and harness along. Mid-way through the trip I realized I just want to go climbing all the time and ended up buying a rope and draws. At this point I was in Europe, but as a new climber, I didn't know where all the good crags were, if they were in season, if I was strong enough to climb there, etc...
            There were decent resources out there like mountain project and climb-europe.com but neither of those were good at filtering down to the places worth making a trip to; you'd have to do a ton of manual research. So that's when I thought of Climbcation; what if I could just put in a couple basic parameters, like where in the world I am, what time of year is it, what type of climbing I want to do, and how hard I climb which would retrieve a bunch of results for places I should go climbing at.
          </p>

          <p>
            Climbcation is just that. If you have an idea of what you want to do on a climbing trip, this site will give you your options to pick from.
          </p>

          <h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Climbing has changed my life. I have fully immersed myself in this awesome sport and community. I have met so many cool people and climbed on so many routes that others have developed, it was important for me to give back. This project is a way for me to help out the community so I hope you find it useful.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this project I had to lean on the climbing community for some help. I want to thank all of the gyms below for letting me pester their clientele to add new destinations to Climbcation!
